# Equalify Contributing Guide

Equalify is in an Alpha MVP "Wild West" phase.

The only limits are your imagination.

I know this wild west needs rules eventually.

For now, let's hack! 

## Known Quirks

**I am tuned to UX and A11Y errors.**

Fixes and reports of A11Y or UX errors are greatly appreciated.

**My many years of WP dev have trained me to follow [WordPress coding standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards).**

I'm up for any new coding standards!

As for governance and a code of conduct, check out my [discussion around governance](https://github.com/bbertucc/equalify/discussions/91).

## Usable hooks and patterns. 

Check out [/models/hooks.php](/models/hooks.php) and the `_scan` pattern in [/actions/scan_all_pages.php](/actions/scan_all_pages.php).

## Progress Depends on Bugs
I am inspired by the development of [Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg).

A community of engaged devs builds the future of WordPress around issues that are reported by users. Check out the [Help Wanted](https://github.com/bbertucc/equalify/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) and [Good First Issue](https://github.com/bbertucc/equalify/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) tags for issues that we need particular help on.

We can build a more accessible internet together.

Here if you need anything!
