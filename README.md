## How will Equalify increase content accessibility?

To improve content accessibility, Equalify aims to:
1. **Reduce the cost** of full site, multi-page scans.
2. **Improve automation** that simplifies WCAG issue resolution.
3. **Promote transparency** to improve A11Y tools and standards.

Moreover, Equalify creates deep integrations with services that run your website. 

_Imagine: You solve WCAG issues at their source - be that source the server or a CMS._

Equalify will become your WebOps hub, designed to solve any accessibility issue.

## What does Equalify currently do?

The app currently scans websites for WCAG errors.

You can import pages from XML sitemaps, WordPress, and single URLs. Equalify then crawls all your pages for WCAG 2.1 errors using the popular [WAVE scan](https://wave.webaim.org/).

Every alert is reported on a filterable dashboard.
