# Equalify the web!

**96.8% of homepages are inaccessible**, according to [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/projects/million/).

That statistic is unacceptable.

Everyone should have access to online information.

## How will Equalify increase accessibility?

Equalify creates deep integrations with services that run your website. 

Imagine: You solve A11Y issues at their source - be that source the server or a CMS. 

Equalify will become your WebOps hub, designed to solve any accessibility issue.

## What does Equalify currently do?

The app currently scans pages for WCAG errors.

Equalify supports [Little Forest](https://littleforest.co.uk/feature/web-accessibility/), a free WCAG 2.1 scan, and the popular [WAVE scan](https://wave.webaim.org/). 

After selecting an integration, import any site.

The app imports pages from XML sitemaps, the WordPress API, and single URLs.

After all your pages are added, click "Scan" and Equalify reports WCAG errors as they are found.

The goal: **Equalify every website.**
