## Features
Equalify is designed to manage large amounts of accessibility notices. The following features make it easier for you to do that:
- **Dynamic Reporting**: Filter custom reports to notices around specific sites, issue types, code snippets, and messages.
- **Historic Analysis**: View your fixes and issues over time.
- **Automatic Status Updates**: When you resolve an automated notice, it's automatically marked it "equalified".
- **Multi-page Scan**: Scan many pages on a website for accessibility notices.
- **Extendable Integrations**: Create or activate existing integrations to add new A11y features to Equalify.
- **Manual Notice Creation**: Manually add and update notices. That means you can add notices from your user tests!
