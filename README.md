## Better Accessibility Management
Equalify aims to be the most useful accessibility platform. That means faster scanning, more accurate results, and a more intuitive user interface. We publish Equalify code here so that you can run the platform locally, building new features and contributing issues.

## Managed Service
Not technical? Want to support Equalify?

Visit [https://equalify.app](https://equalify.app) to try our hosted service.

The service is <strong>fully supported</strong> and <strong>super fast</strong>. Plus, you'll get these features:
- Automatic Scans
- Scheduled Scans

Your support sustains open source work.
