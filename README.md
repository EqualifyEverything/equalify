## Big Changes are Coming!
Equalify has officially transitioned to a project of the [University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) Technology Solutions](https://it.uic.edu/about/technology-solutions/ "University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) Technology Solutions") department! This marks a new chapter for Equalify, but we remain focused on our goal: bringing top-in-class acessibility scanning and reporting tools to the widest possible audience. 

We built Equalify as a multi-tenant, SaaS platform, but after 3 years and tens of thousands of scans, we believe users want something different - something simple, robust, and easy-to-use, and that can be deployed by users themselves, *without* a dedicated DevOps team. That means we'll be moving in a new direction for Equalify, with the goal of a streamlined application, with straightforward deployment. We aim to make Equalify as easy to install as any popular open source project. Here's what this means:

### What to Expect:

- **Ease of Deployment** 
Our priority will be to make it as simple and painless as possible for users to spin up their own instances of Equalify
- **Unified Codebase**
A consolidated codebase, to make it simpler for developers to contribute and act as a single entry point for end users and developers
- **Customization**
Prioritize extensibility, and make it as straightforward as possible for users to add their own scans, modify the user interface, etc
- **Better Documentation**
Simplify adoption by unifying and expanding existing documentation
- **Always Open Source**
Continued Open Source development under the AGPL.
- **Best Accessible User Experience**
Fixing accessibility bugs is mission-critical to Equalify.

### Beta Roadmap (Q1 2026)
- **Technology that Promotes our Open Source Community**
  - Deployment in 30 minutes or less
  - Handles 100 pages/minute without breaking a sweat
  - Costs less than $1000/month for typical usage
  - No critical bugs
  - Documentation that doesn't suck
