## Features
Equalify is designed to manage large amounts of accessibility alerts. The following features make it easier for you to do that:
- **Dynamic Reporting**: Filter custom reports to alerts around specific sites, issue types, code snippets, and messages.
- **Historic Analysis**: View your fixes and issues over time.
- **Automatic Status Updates**: When you resolve an automated alert, it's automatically marked it "equalified".
- **Multi-page Scan**: Scan many pages on a website for accessibility alerts.
- **Extendable Integrations**: Create or activate existing integrations to add new A11y features to Equalify.
- **Manual Alert Creation**: Manually add and update alerts. That means you can add alerts from your user tests!
