Equalify is the world's first Open Source WebOps platform.

The project aims to integrate all your websites and services into one dashboard.

## Why manage WebOps in one place?
WebOps needs to be integrated.

Your server's health affects your CMS, which affects accessibility and analytics.

Bringing WebOps data under one roof means **richer reporting** and **smarter management** of your website properties.

## What's Equalify's story?
I ([@bbertucc](https://github.com/bbertucc/)) took a sabbatical from [my web design business](https://decubing.com/) to create an ethical business. I spent several months with [on Notion](https://bbertucc.notion.site/Ethical-Business-7d8cb00d2e5f4558998450d6e38a61b6) before I had the confidence to write the code in this repo. 

Now, I release Equalify - errata and all. 

I aim to find collaborators and users to shape the future of Equalify.
