# Equalify the web!

**96.8% of home pages have WCAG conformance failures**.[^1] Failing WCAG conformance means countless people with disabilities do not have equal access to the internet.

**Equalify aims to make websites more accessible.** We are building an affordable and easy-to-use platform that integrates your favorite WebOps. All of our work is open source, published under the [AGPL](https://github.com/bbertucc/equalify/blob/main/LICENSE). Working this way helps us create the most accessible platform for internet accessibility.

## How will Equalify increase content accessibility?

Accessibility is a diverse category of work. Equalify focuses on [Web Accessibility Guidelines Version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) (WCAG) standards. We are building tools that help website managers align their sites with WCAG guidelines. Our tools will integrate automated WCAG testing services, web services, and teaching materials into one WebOps platform.

## What does Equalify currently do?

The app currently scans websites for WCAG errors.

You can import pages from WordPress, XML sitemaps, and single URLs. Equalify then crawls all your pages for WCAG 2.1 errors using the popular [WAVE scan](https://wave.webaim.org/).

Every alert is reported on a filterable dashboard.
