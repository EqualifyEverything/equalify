# Equalify the web!

**96.8% of hompages are inaccessible**, according to [WebAim](https://webaim.org/projects/million/).

That statistic is unacceptable.

Everyone should have access to online information.

## How will Equalify increase accessibility?

Equalify creates deep integrations with services that run your website. 

We will become a WebOps hub, designed to solve accessibility issues.

## What does Equalify currently do?

Equalify is in its infancy.

The app currently scans pages for WCAG errors.

Any site can be added to Equalify.

The app currently supports two integrations: [Little forrest](https://littleforest.co.uk/feature/web-accessibility/), a free WCAG 2.1 scan, and the popular [WAVE scan](https://wave.webaim.org/). 

After selecting an integration, import a site.

The app supports XML sitemaps, WordPress sites, and single pages.

Click "Scan" and Equalify reports WCAG errors as they are found.

The goal: **Equalify every website.**
